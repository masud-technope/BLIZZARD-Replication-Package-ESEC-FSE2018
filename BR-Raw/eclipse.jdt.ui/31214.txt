Bug 31214 – [Show in] Fails for Package Explorer in non-Java project
- create a simple project P
- create a simple file called "x.java" in P
- open it with the Default Text Editor
- in the editor activate "Show in" and select Package Explorer as target
-> nothing happens even if P and "x.java" are visible in the Package Explorer
