Bug 297593 – [type wizards] Java class wizard gives incorrect warning message
Build id: I20091210-1301
1.
Make a new Java project.
2.
File > New > Class
3.
Give it a name.
4.
The warning says 'The use of the default package is discouraged.', that's fine.
5.
Now in the source folder text field, change it from 'test/src' to 'test/' or 'test'.
6.
Now the warning says 'Source folder is not a Java project.' even though 'test' really is a Java project.
This is slightly misleading.
The warning message should state that it is not a Java source folder or something of that sort.
