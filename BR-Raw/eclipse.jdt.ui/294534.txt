Bug 294534 – [hashcode/equals] Code generation for equals() where an enum attribute is used should not use .equals but ==

This is more of an enhancement to the code generation feature in JDT.
I have a class that has an enum attribute and when I use the "source->Generate hashCode() and equals()..." action.
The equals method treated the enum attribute as a standard class with null checks and made use of .equals(..) etc.
It should just have generated the following instead:
if(other.enumValue!=enumValue)
return false;
Reproducible: Always
