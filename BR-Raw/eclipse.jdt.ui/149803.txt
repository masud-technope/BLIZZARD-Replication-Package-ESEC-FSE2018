Bug 149803 – [quick assist] 'exchange left and right operands' for all comparison types
Currently we have the quick fix 'exchange left and right operands for infix expression' that can be applied to == comparisons
e.g., if(a == b) --> if(b == a)
However, it would also be useful to have this quickfix for less-than, greater-than etc.
- although obviously this is slightly more complex as it must take into account the change in the logic.
I believe the following would be correct:
if(a > b)  --> if(b <= a)
if(a >= b) --> if(b < a)
if(a < b)  --> if(b >= a)
if(a <= b) --> if(b > a)
