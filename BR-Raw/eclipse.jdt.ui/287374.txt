Bug 287374 – [extract method] Allows extracting lhs of full qualified expression
The refactoring correctly warns you if you try to extract the lefthandside of an assignment.
In case you only select the SimpleName of a FieldAccess the refactoring works but produces illegal code.
Snippet:
public class A {
int i;
public void f() {
this./*[*/i/*]*/ = 4;
}
}
Extract method on "i" and you end up with
public class A {
int i;
public void f() {
this.extracted() = 4;
}
private int extracted() {
return /*[*/i/*]*/;
}
}
Expected would be an error message as we already do if you select the whole left hand side.
Maybe we can reuse SnippetFinder#isLeftHandSideOfAssignment that will be introduced by bug 264606
