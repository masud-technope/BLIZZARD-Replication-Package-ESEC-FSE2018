Bug 294768 – [clean up] Save Action; 'Add final modifier to private fields' over aggressive
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.15) Gecko/2009102815 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.15

The java save action 'Add final modifier to private fields' will apply a final modifier to a member variable that is defined as transient.
As final transient member fields are almost always wrong, (as after serialization the field will be null) i believe that eclipse should not be doing this save action when the field is transient.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a member that is private and transient.
2.turn on java save action "Add final modifier to private fields"
3.save the class
4.the final attribute is applied to the transient member field
