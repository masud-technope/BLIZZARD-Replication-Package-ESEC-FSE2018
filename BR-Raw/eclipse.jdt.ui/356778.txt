Bug 356778 – [search] "Inexact Type Arguments" filter is not showing up even when results are filtered
The "Inexact Type Arguments" filter is not showing up even when results are filtered with this filter.
##########
public class Test<T> {
public void standard(T t) {
}
public <U> T generic(U u) {
return null;
}
public void foo() {
Test<Object>t = new Test<Object>();
t.<Object>generic(null);
t.<String>generic(null);
t.standard(null);
new Test<String>().standard(null);
}
}
##########
Reproducible steps:
1.
Paste the above program
2.
Select 'generic' in the function foo() and search for references.
3.
There will be two references.
Now, filter one of the results by filtering InExact Type Arguments.
4.
Now select 'standard' in the function foo() and search for references.
5.
You should see only one result and see that one reference is filtered.
However, you don't see that filter in the view menu.
