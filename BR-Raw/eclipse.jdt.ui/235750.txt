Bug 235750 – [clean up] 'Save Actions' doesn't add override annotation for interface method implementations (Java6)
Build ID: M20080221-1800
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create an interface with a method
2.
Manually create an implementation of that interface's method in a class.
(Must be manual, because using automatic code generation puts in the annotation.)
3.
Save the file.
4.
The override annotation isn't added as expected.
More information:
The problem doesn't happen when automatically generating the method stub (cursor in the editor window; using ctrl+<space> and selecting the interface method).
Note: The Java6 API javadoc doesn't mention that interface method implementations can use the override annotation, but it is supported by the compiler.
What is the difference between [Java -> Code Style -> Clean Up] and [Java -> Editor -> Save Actions]?
I'm using the built-in eclipse profile for Clean Up.
Both have the same setting enabled for "Add missing '@Override' annotations"
