Provide a javadoc location url, take:
http://72.5.124.55/javaee/5/docs/api/
5.
Ok
6.
Reopen the javadoc property page
7.
Change url to:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/
8.
Ok
9.
Reopen the javadoc property page
Is:
The javadoc location url is still http://72.5.124.55/javaee/5/docs/api/
Should:
be changed to http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/
72.5.124.55 resolves to java.sun.com.
I guess a compare is made on the URLs, which resolves the IP and hence the dialog thinks, that the two urls are equals.
Workaround is to change the url to a dummy url first and then to the correct one.
