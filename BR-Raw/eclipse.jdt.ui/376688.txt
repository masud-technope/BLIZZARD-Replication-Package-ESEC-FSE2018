Bug 376688 – [type wizards] New class wizard doesn't remember setting for which method stubs to create
Build Identifier: 3.8.0 I20120314-1800
Which checkboxes are selected in "Which method stubs would you like to create?" is not remembered across invocations of the new class wizard although NewPackageWizardPage tries to save them.
The problem seems to be that NewPackageWizardPage#setVisible(false) is never invoked because WizardDialog#finishPressed() sends #hardClose()
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Invoke the New Class wizard
2.
Check "public static void main(String[] args)"
3.
Uncheck "Constructors from superclass"
4.
Uncheck "Inherited abstract methods"
5.
Create the class
6.
Invoke the New Class wizard again
Expected result:
Which method stubs would you like to create?
[x] public static void main(String[] args)
[ ] Constructors from superclass
[ ] Inherited abstract methods
Actual result:
Which method stubs would you like to create?
[ ] public static void main(String[] args)
[ ] Constructors from superclass
[x] Inherited abstract methods
