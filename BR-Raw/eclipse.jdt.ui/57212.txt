Bug 57212 – Views should adapt their orientation depending on the view size
Users can now change the orientation of a fast view and we should be smart to
adapt the inner view orientation as well.
see the TestRunnerViewPart for an example.
This needs to be fixed in both the Call hierarchy and the type hierarchy.
We should consider whether we add an "automatic" layout mode to the menu and
make it the default.
