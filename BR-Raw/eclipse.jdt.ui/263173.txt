Bug 263173 – [clean up] [actions] Member sort can break code when initializers are moved
Build ID: M20080911-1700
Steps To Reproduce:
Given this class:
class Test {
static int someInt;
static {
someInt = 1;
}
static int anotherInt = someInt;
}
1.
Source->Sort Members...->Do not sort fields...->Ok
The sorted code will be:
class Test {
static int someInt;
static int anotherInt = someInt;
static {
someInt = 1;
}
}
This breaks the code because order of initialization has changed.
More information:
If the user has selected "Do not sort fields, enum constants, and initializers", eclipse should not move initializers (including static or instance initializer blocks).
