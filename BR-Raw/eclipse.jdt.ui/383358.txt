Bug 383358 – [convert local] The Quick Assist action is not offered when a use of a local var is selected
Build id: 20120606-2254
Quick Assist offers the action "Convert local variable to field" only when the declaration of a variable is selected not its use.
In the following example, if the user selects variable 'a' in the declaration statement and presses CTRL+1, the Quick Assist menu will offer the "Convert local variable to field" action.
However, if the user selects the variable 'a' where it's used in the `println` method, the Quick Assist menu will no longer offer the action.
```
public class C {
public void main() {
// "Convert local variable to field" is available for the following local variable declaration 'a'.
int a = 1;
// "Convert local variable to field" is unavailable for the following use of the local variable 'a'.
System.out.println(a);
}
}
```
As part of the CodingSpectator study, we found that Quick Assist is a popular method of invoking refactorings <http://codingspectator.cs.illinois.edu/Blog/ProgrammersPreferContextAwareAndLightWeightMethodsOfInvokingAutomatedRefactorings>.
Offering the "Convert local variable to field" action both at declaration and use sites of local variables makes this refactoring more accessible to programmers.
Is excluding the "Convert local variable to field" action at use sites of local variables intentional?
