Bug 13269 – Incorrect operation order in jarpackager
Steps:
1)select some packages and export jar
2)select 'Export java source files and resources'
3)Next
4)select in 'Save description of this JAR in workspace' a .jardesc that already
exists.
5)Next
6)Select 'Use existing manifest from workspace' and choose a manifest that
already exist (this is easiest if you run the wizard once and then a second
time with the presevered settings).
7)Finish
8)A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your .jardesc file.
Choose NO.
9)A dialog will appear asking if you wish to overwrite your manifest file.
Choose NO.
Note that an error dialog appears saying JAR creation failed, because saving
manifest to workspace failed and saving description to workspace failed.
If you
click okay you will return to the wizard.
10)Choose Cancel.
Go to were your .jar file was to have been generated and note that it was
indeed created.
This is because the jar file is created before the overwrite
verifications happen.
Other notes:
-the messages 'saving manifest file failed' is perhaps incorrect in this case
as the user chose not to overwrite the manifest file (thus it is not really a
failure).
Same goes for '.jardesc' file.
-prehaps a warning in the wizard's header (now that an icon is shown as well)
would be better in the case of the '.jardesc' file then a dialog box at the
end.
Either way not overwriting this file should not cause the wizard to not
complete its operation.
-The 'use existing manifest from workspace' option should not save a new
manifest file.
If the user wants that they should use the 'save the manifest in
the workspace' option combined with the 'reuse and save the manifest in the
workspace' option.
