Bug 298281 – [introduce factory] Introduce Factory gets confused when replacing vararg constructor
Build Identifier: I20091210-1301
I've managed to boil the issue down to the following code:
public class Thing {
private Thing[] subthings;
public Thing() {
subthings = new Thing[]{};
}
public Thing(Thing...
subthings) {
this.subthings = subthings;
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
System.out.println(new Thing(new Thing(new Thing()), new Thing(new Thing())).subthings.length);
}
}
Attempts to replace the vararg constructor with a factory using the Introduce Factory refactoring tool results in:
public class Thing {
private Thing[] subthings;
public Thing() {
subthings = new Thing[]{};
}
private Thing(Thing...
subthings) {
this.subthings = subthings;
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
System.out.println(createThing(createThing(new Thing())).subthings.length);
}
public static Thing createThing(Thing...
subthings) {
return new Thing(subthings);
}
}
The refactored version loses an entire subtree.
Reproducible: Always
