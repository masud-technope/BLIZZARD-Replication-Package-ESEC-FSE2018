Bug 385237 – [move member type] Moving a member interface to its own file adds the host's type parameters to it
Build Identifier: I20120608 - 1400
Interfaces are inherently static, therefore interfaces that are members of an enclosing type do not inherit type parameters from their hosts.
 The Eclipse compiler knows this.
 For example, given this code
class Foo<T> {
interface Bar {
T baz();
}
}
the compiler reports an error "Cannot make a static reference to the non-static type T".
 Perfect.
The refactoring engine seems to be confused on this issue, however.
 If we correct the above code to
class Foo<T> {
interface Bar {
void baz();
}
}
and then attempt to refactor it to a top-level type via Refactor > Move Type to New File, then the original host class's type parameter(s) are added to the resulting top-level interface:
interface Bar<T> {
void baz();
}
The original, unparametrized interface is erroneously transformed into a parametrized one.
 At least the refactoring engine is (maddeningly) consistent in that it adds the new type parameter to all declarations involving the moved interface type.
 What a mess!
For comparison, the refactoring engine gets it right with static classes: the host's type parameters do not get tagged onto a static member class when it is moved to top level.
 In particular, if the example interface is changed to a pure abstract class then it does not get an added type parameter when it is moved.
I am inclined to rate the severity of this issue as "Major", as it can do quite a lot of damage, but I leave it as "Normal" instead mainly because I suspect that this kind of refactoring is relatively uncommon.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create a parametrized class with a member interface
2.
In the Java editor, right-click the name of the member interface and select "Refactor" > "Move Type to New File..." from the context menus
3.
Click "Ok" on the confirmation dialog
