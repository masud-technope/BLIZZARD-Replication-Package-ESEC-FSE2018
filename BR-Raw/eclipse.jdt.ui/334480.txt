Bug 334480 – [quick fix] create method incorrectly makes static method when called from inner class in static method
Build Identifier: M20100909-0800
Consider Following Java class 'Foo'
public class Foo {
public static void bar(final Foo f) {
new Object() {
void foo() {
f.foobar(); // invoke quick fix here
}
};
}
}
When you execute the quick fix "Create method 'foobar()' in type 'Foo'", eclipse makes a static method in Foo:
protected static void foobar() {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
}
A non-static method would be correct as we are invoking foobar explicitly on an instance of Foo.
So the correct method in Foo would be
protected void foobar() {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
}
Note: If bar is non-static, the correct method is already made by the quick fix.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create class Foo as given in the description
2.
Invoke the create method quick fix
