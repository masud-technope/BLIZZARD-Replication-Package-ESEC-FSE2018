Bug 162434 – [content assist] Code conpletion for 'for' doesn't choose the correct collection
N20061026-0010
When using the 'for' xource code completion it used to automatically choose the most recently defined collection but now doesn't...
If I enter the following line...
List trimParts = presentation.getLayout().getTrimForParts();
...and hot Ctrl-Space and select 'iterate over collection' I now get the following...
for (Iterator iterator = alwaysOffActionSets.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
type name = (type) iterator.next();
}
Note that the collection is 'alwaysOffActionSets' rather than 'trimParts' which is what I used to get.
Not sure but perhaps the choice is alphabetical now?
