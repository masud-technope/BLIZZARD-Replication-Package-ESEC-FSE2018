Bug 332271 – [quick assist] Use ()+ icon for quick assists which add parentheses around expressions
Created attachment 184920 [details]
fix
I found three, which do not use this icon
- Add paranoiac parenthesis for conditions
- Put 'instanceof' in parentheses
- Put 'instanceof' in parentheses
Is there a reason for not doing this ?
(Note: JavaPluginImages.IMG_CORRECTION_CAST is not a great name for this icon but I have not changed this for now)
