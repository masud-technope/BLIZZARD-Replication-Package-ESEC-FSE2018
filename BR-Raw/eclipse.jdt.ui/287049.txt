Bug 287049 – [actions] 'Add Import' always marks the editor as if it has unsaved changes
Build ID: I20090611-1540
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Save the Java source file.
2.
Put the cursor to any class name which already has an appropriate 'import' statement or doesn't need it, press Shift-Ctrl-M or use corresponding menu item for 'Add Import'.
The editor will be marked by an asterisk as if it has unsaved changes, and the 'Save' button on the toolbar will become available, but no text is really changed.
More information:
Example:
import java.util.Map;
public class AddImport {
Map map;
String s;
}
Pressing Shift-Ctrl-M on either 'Map' or 'String' causes the described things to happen.
