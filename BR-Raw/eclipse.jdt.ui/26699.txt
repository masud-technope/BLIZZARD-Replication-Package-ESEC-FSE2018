Bug 26699 – Create Jar fails with no warning if jar read-only
Once *.jardesc has been created, if I invoke "Create JAR" from the context menu
and the jar file already exists and is read-only, the progress dialog flashes
and nothing more happens.
Please add check for this condition and at least an error message should be
displayed.
Even better, ask something like "Jar file read-only, overwrite?" Y/N
and overwrite the file on yes (similar to what the option "warn if jar file
exists" does).
