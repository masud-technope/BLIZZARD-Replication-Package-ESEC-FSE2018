Bug 303705 – [search] Custom search results not shown hierarchically in the java search results view
Build Identifier: M20090917-0800
Consider an instance of org.eclipse.search.ui.text.Match with an element that is neither an IResource nor an IJavaElement.
It might be an element in a class diagram, for example.
When such an element is reported, it will be shown as a plain, flat element in the otherwise hierarchical java search results view.
This is because the LevelTreeContentProvider and its superclasses only check for IJavaElement and IResource.
I propose to also check for IAdaptable and try to adapt to IJavaElement and IResource, if the other checks fail.
I'll attach a patch.
Reproducible: Always
