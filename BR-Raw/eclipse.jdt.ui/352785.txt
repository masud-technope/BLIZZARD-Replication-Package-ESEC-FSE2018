Bug 352785 – [extract method] Refactor > Extract Method with break statement in switch causes NPE
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
If I attempt to Refactor > Extract Method which includes a break statement inside a switch, an unexpected exception occurs, which is an NPE (will attach stack later).
It should give an error which says something like you can't refactor a method which includes multiple exit points, or something like that.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Write some code:
public void foo(int i) {
switch (i) {
case 1:
if (true) {
break;
}
}
}
2.
Highlight the some code within the case 1 statement.
3.
Choose Refactor > Extract Method
