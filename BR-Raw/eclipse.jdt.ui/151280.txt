Bug 151280 – [misc] Providing a JavaSourceViewerConfiguration to SemanticHighlightingManager
We're (ab)using JDT in order to implement IDE-support for a language extension (see http://www.objectteams.org).
We're reusing lots of internal JDT code, that was not meant to be reused.
In order to provide syntax highlighting, we provide a subclass of JavaSourceViewerConfiguration (with a specialized JavaCodeScanner), to a subclass of CompilationUnitEditor.
There is one problem however:
A SemanticHighlightingManager that is attached to a JavaEditor, directly instantiates another JavaSourceViewerConfiguration, thus working with the original JavaSourceViewerConfiguration instead of our subclass.
It would be very helpful if SemanticHighlightingManager could operate on an instance of our class.
This could be achieved by having a factory method in JavaEditor, that SemanticHighlightingManager could call in its install() method.
We could override that method to return our own JavaSourceViewerConfiguration.
Another option would be to let JavaEditor pass an instance of JavaSourceViewerConfiguration to SemanticHighlightingManager's install() method.
We would be very grateful if this small change could be added.
