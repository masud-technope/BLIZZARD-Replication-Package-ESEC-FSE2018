Bug 309977 – Classpath variable initialization doesn't fail silently
Build Identifier: 3.6.0 I20100312-1448
We have a classpath variable initializer which may or may not set the actual variable depending on certain conditions.
According to the Javadoc for the ClasspathVariableInitializer.initialize(), it is ok to fail silently:
Binds a value to the workspace classpath variable with the given name, or fails silently if this cannot be done.
When we fail silenty by having the method just return, the .log file contains an entry:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.ui 4 10001 2010-04-21 10:52:23.125
!MESSAGE VariableBlock: Classpath variable with null value: FOO_VAR
This is not a silent failure - at least not to our product's users.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
In a self-hosting environment, create a simple variable initializer that does nothing.
2.
Launch an instance of the runtime configuration.
3.
Open Window => Preferences => Java => Build Path => Classpath Variables
4.
See the .log file
