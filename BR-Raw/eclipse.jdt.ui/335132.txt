Bug 335132 – [actions] Override / Implement dialog size / position are not saved
Build Identifier: 20100917-0705
The size and position of "override/implement method" dialog box is not saved.
If I make the dialog larger to see more methods at once (I have a large monitor), then on subsequent invocations the dialog resets to default size / position.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Bring up override/implement method dialog.
2.
Resize the dialog, e.g.
make it larger.
3.
Finish by overriding a method (clicking "Ok)
4.
Bring up the dialog again.
---> The dialog has the old, default size - its size and position are not saved.
