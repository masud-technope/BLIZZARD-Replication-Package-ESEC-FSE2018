Bug 239695 – [jar exporter] Cannot export JAR to a project folder of a project outside the workspace
Build ID: I20080617-2000
Steps To Reproduce:
1.
Create a new Java project, and delete it again (do not delete contents)
2.
Move the java project somewhere outside the workspace using Windows Explorer
3.
Create a new Java project from existing source, select that place.
4.
File->Export->Jar file, Next
5.
Select that project in the "resources to export"
6.
Browse for export destination, select the project folder and some filename (example.jar).
7.
Click Finish.
Actual result:
Eclipse asks if it should create the folder inside the workspace (in the Explorer selector, I selected the existing folder outside the workspace) and if I say yes, the Jar is exported into the new folder in the workspace.
Expected result:
The jar is stored in the project directory outside the workspace
Workaround: Type the full path to the project directory into the export destination box manually.
