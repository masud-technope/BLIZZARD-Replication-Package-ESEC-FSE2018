Bug 296229 – @code tag always prepended by space
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; sv-SE; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009091008 Iceweasel/3.0.14 (Debian-3.0.14-1)

The {@code} tag is always prepended by a space when Javadoc is displayed.
For example, the text "non-{@code null}" is rendered as "non- null".
This is not the case in Javadoc generated by e.g.
the javadoc tool.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Create a Javadoc comment
2.
Type a sentence that contains a {@code} block immediately preceded by some other text.
3.
View the Javadoc and observe the inserted space.
