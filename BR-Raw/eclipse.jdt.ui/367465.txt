Bug 367465 – [jar exporter] Runnable Jar File Export "repacks referenced libraries" warning cannot be disabled
Build Identifier: 20110615-0604
When exporting to a Runnable Jar file with Library Handling option "Extract required libraries into the generated JAR", a warning dialog box appears that begins with "This operation repacks referenced libraries.
Please review the licenses associated...".
There is a checkbox on the dialog to disable the message, but it has no effect.

Obtain a library jar file.
I downloaded jdom-1.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.jdom.org/dist/binary/

Go to Project / Properties menu / Java Build Path / Libraries tab.
3.
Select Add Jars and select <download_dir>/jdom-1.1.2.jar
4.
Select File > Export, then Java > Runnable Jar file
5.
In Jar Export Window, select the following
- Launch Configuration:  Select project being exported
- Export Destination: Select folder and enter jar file name, e.g.
myProgram,jar
- Library Handling: Extract required libraries into the generated JAR
6.
Click Finish ...warning will appear
7.
Check "Do not show this message again"
8.
Repeat steps 4-6.
...warning still appears.
