Bug 350733 – Breakpoint condition editor needs a height hint

code from HEAD
while testing switch-on-String support in conditional breakpoints I found that if you have a really long condition and open the breakpoint properties dialog, it will be the entire height of the screen before it will scroll.
Consider the following condition:
String test = "two";
switch (test) {
case "one":
System.out.println("one from condition");
return true;
case "two":
System.out.println("two from condition");
String innertest = "innerone";
switch(innertest) {
case "innerone": {
System.out.println("innerone from inner condition");
return true;
}
default: {
System.out.println("fail from inner condition");
return false;
}
}
return true;
case "three":
System.out.println("three from condition");
return true;
case "four":
System.out.println("four from condition");
return true;
case "five":
System.out.println("five from condition");
return true;
default:
System.out.println("Fail from condition");
return false;
}
After it opens if you try to resize the properties dialog the condition text editor does not resize, instead the dialog scrolls, which is annoying.
