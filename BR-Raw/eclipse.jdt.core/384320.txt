Bug 384320 – [1.8][compiler] Syntax error while mixing type annotations & reference expressions.
BETA_JAVA8:
The following contrived test case refuses to compile and we get
"Syntax error on token "X", .
expected after this token"
// ----------------------
interface I {
void foo(X<String> s, int x);
}
@Foo({"hello"})
public class X<T> {
I i = X<@Foo({"hello"}) String>::foo;
void foo(int x) {
}
}
@interface Foo {
String [] value();
}
It should compile.
The problem comes from the black list strategy used
in the scanner to bound look ahead.
It incorrectly assumes that the
tokens '{' and '}' cannot feature in type arguments, but they can as
this example shows.
We need to choose the black list with more rigor
if we want to use it at all.
