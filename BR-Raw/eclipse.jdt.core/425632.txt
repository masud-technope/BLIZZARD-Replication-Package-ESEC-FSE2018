Bug 425632 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler gets the scope of enhanced for loop's expression wrong.
See https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7139681
javac8 has started compiling this code:
// --
public class X {
int[] i = {1, 2, 3};
void foo() {
for (int i : i) {
System.out.println(i);
}
}
}
while eclipse continues to reject it.
