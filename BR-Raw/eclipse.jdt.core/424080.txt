Bug 424080 – [1.8][completion] Workbench hanging on code completion with lambda expression containing anonymous class
interface FI {
public static int val = 5;
default int run (String x) { return 1;};
public int run (int x);
}
public class Test {
FI fi = x -> (new FI() { public int run (int x) {return 2;}}).run("")val;
}
Please try to put a dot '.', before the last 'val' in the 2nd last line.
See the workbench hanging.
