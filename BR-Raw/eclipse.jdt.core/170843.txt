Bug 170843 – deleteDerivedResources should ignore ResourceException
The FileSystemUtil.deleteDerivedResources() method is used to delete generated files.
 It in turn calls IResource.delete(), and passes any resulting CoreException up the stack.
We are getting occasional instances of "org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Problems encountered while deleting resources", which appear to be due either to file locking or to simultaneous deletion of projects during testing.
There does not seem to be any good reason to pass these exceptions up the stack - arguably we should log the failure, but we should not be throwing an exception.
The problem is reported against 3.2.1, but it is not severe enough to warrant fixing in 3.2.2.
 It should be fixed in 3.3.
