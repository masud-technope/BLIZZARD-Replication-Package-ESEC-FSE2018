Bug 385111 – [1.8][compiler] Compiler fails to flag undefined annotation type.
BETA_JAVA8:
The grammar rules introduced at 1.7 time to support diamond, union types
and try-with-resources need to be harmonized for JSR308 related changes.
The grammar file in the 308 branch was completely oblivious to these changes
made in master/head version of grammar.
During the merge, the new rules
from master/head were integrated into the grammar by mere textual insertion
and resolution of conflicts where they occurred.
This is not enough as
illustrated by this example, where we fail to flag an undefined annotation
type.
Also conflict-resolution adopted at merge time is not always proper and needs
scrutiny (e.g Type0 should have been used in places where TypeInternal is
used)
