Bug 71702 – code completion doesn't work anymore after Array cast.
using this code:
package foo;
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class foo
{
public foo(int x)
{
String[] tmp = new String[10];
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
tmp = (String[])al.toArray(tmp);
}
}
then after the Array cast (String[])
code completion doesn't work anymore
I am using version:
Version: 3.1.0
Build id: 200408031300
but i also now that this also happens in 3.0 code.
