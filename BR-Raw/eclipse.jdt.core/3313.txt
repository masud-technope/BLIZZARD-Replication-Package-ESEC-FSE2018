Bug 3313 – Severe - Performance - Java Model redundancies (1GFKTUN)
Look for senders of addChild...
you'll notice CompilationUnitStructureRequestor has several which also include
addField/Method/MemberType being sent to SourceTypeElementInfo's.
So for the typical type which has a 2 fields & 20 methods, you have:
- an 23 element array of all children,
- a 2 element field array &
- a 20 element method array.
Quite the overhead (~120 bytes) for no real value...
getFields/Methods could easily be implemented to extract
the items out of the children.
