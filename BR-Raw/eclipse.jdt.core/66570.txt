Bug 66570 – Code assist fails due to capitalization
Build 20040609
If I code assist on "bundle", I don't get the type "org.osgi.framework.Bundle" in the list of
proposals.
The first proposal I see is "org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator".
Code assisting on
"Bundle" correctly gives me the type "org.osgi.framework.Bundle".
In case it matters, I was doing
this code assist at the the top of the method ExternalToolsBuilder#build(...)
